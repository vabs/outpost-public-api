Outpost.Travel's Public API
===========================

Powered by Eve_ and `Outpost.Travel`_.

First words
===========
This API gives you access to over 700,000 place rental listings across the world that are part of the Sharing Economy. Additionally, there are over 30,000 peer-to-peer experiences and tens of thousands of new rideshares updated everyday. 
Please note that this API is in its first weeks of development so bugs may be found. To report said bugs or suggest feature for the future, file an issue on the GitHub_ page. As of now there is no rate-limiting or authenitcation but those will follow in the upcomming weeks. Please don't abuse this.

Let's get started
=================
As of now it is only possible to do GET requests against the API but POST is likely to be added soon.
